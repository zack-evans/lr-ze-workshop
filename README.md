## Before starting
To start using GitHub Copilot, you will need to install it on a supported IDE. The following IDE's provide a more complete Copilot experience as they both include Copilot's code completion and Chat features.

Installation steps:
- [VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide) 
- [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.8 and later](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide?tool=visualstudio)
- [JetBrains IDE's](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide?tool=jetbrains)
   - ex: Intellij, Pycharm, Webstorm, etc

**It's recommended to use VS Code** for the best GitHub Copilot experience as it will offer built-in features that other IDE's do not yet support. This includes:
- automated code review
- multi-file editing
- custom instructions for generating code/tests and performing code reviews
